:luc_info: Consider using a dns filter at the network level, that filter your queries with blocklists. Use DOH or DOT if possible.

:luc_check_circle: I recommending **Adguard home** over Pi-Hole that is most well-known. Because you can natively configure encryption for your local dns queries and upstream servers as well.
